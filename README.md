## Overview

Magic Lane provides a highly privacy-focused Maps, Location, and Navigation platform, featuring modular and scalable Software Development Kits (SDKs).
This repository provides Swift Package Manager manifests to simplify integration of the Magic Lane Maps SDK into your iOS projects.

## Requirements

- **iOS**: 14.0 or later
- **Xcode**: 13.0 or later
- **Swift**: 5.9 or later

## Getting Started

As the very first step, we highly recommend that you get a token from [Magic Lane Portal](https://developer.magiclane.com/api). If no token is set, you can still test your apps, but a watermark will be displayed, and all the online services including mapping, searching, routing, etc. will slow down after a few minutes.

These guides enable you to get quickly started using Magic Lane - Maps SDK for iOS to render your first interactive map, then plot a route, simulate navigation along the route, and search for points of interest.

The [Magic Lane Studio](https://developer.magiclane.com/studio) can be used to make custom map styles, and render GeoJSON data on your maps.
